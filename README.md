# MechKeebs

An online community for sharing and discovering your next mechanical keyboard.

I'm aware that it's basically an r/mk clone and solves no real problem. Still had fun building it and learned a lot for future projects.

My main goal of this project was to learn how to build a web app with technologies I found interesting. I just wanted to get something deployed out into the world, so I'm happy with how it is now.

## Technologies
### Client/Frontend
- Next.js
- Chakra UI
- SWR
- Hosted on Vercel (https://mechkeebs.com)

### Server/Backend
- Express.js
- TypeORM
- PostgreSQL
- Google Cloud Storage
- Hosted on a $6 DigitalOcean VPS inside a Dokku container (https://api.mechkeebs.com)
