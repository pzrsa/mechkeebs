# MechKeebs

A online community of people sharing their mechanical keyboards.

Realised I was making a r/mk clone, so I kinda got bored of it now.

I might still work on it occasionally, could revive it to be something more valuable and community driven.

My main goal of this project was to learn how to build a web app with technologies I found interesting.

## Technologies
### Web/Frontend
- Next.js
- Chakra UI
- SWR

### Server/Backend
- Express.js
- TypeORM
- PostgreSQL
- Google Cloud Storage
