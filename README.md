# MechKeebs

An online community for sharing and discovering your next mechanical keyboard.

I also wrote an [article](https://parsam.io/articles/mechkeebs) on it.

My main goal of this project was to learn how to build a web app with technologies I found interesting. I just wanted to get something deployed out into the world, so I'm happy with how it is now.

It took me many months to finally complete, but Iâ€™m very happy to finally say it is live in production. You can also see the progress made over the months in the [kanban board](https://github.com/pzrsa/mechkeebs/projects/1).
